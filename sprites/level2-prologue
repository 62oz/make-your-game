As the blood moon begins and the crowds flock to the hills to watch the ceremony, you find yourslef alone in the dark main square of the festival.
The moonlight turns crimson red and covers the landscape in an eerie atmosphere. Your Daruma senses tingle and you notice the air getting unusually thick. Something's off.
You must get across the festival area to get a better look at the eclipse before it ends.
